<h1>Hi</h1>
<p>ノンキャンディです！</p>
<p>I'm currently figuring out how to make a layout on the site. Also, this will be the "mini" version of my page in case you can't handle the fanciness of the site that is going to be, but since it's unfinished, I currently use it as the main page.</p>
<p>In the meantime, hi! I'm Jiu and I am a huge fan of cute things. I am 15 years old and I come from the Philippines. And idk how to code stuff like this website.</p>
<p>Stuff about me: Birthday is Feb 15, I'm 15 years old, I'm bi, I'm an artist, sometimes a gamer, noob musician and noob coder, AuDHD, and I have 0IQ. Someday I will use Linux.
<p>Likes: Cute things, food, Japanese street fashion, the Internet (sometimes), art, anime, open source stuff, music, friends, cute animals, funny memes, games, <s>kawaii moe anime girls</s></p>
<p>Dislikes: Politics, toxic people, war, unfunny or uninteresting memes/trends that got popular for some reason (Skibidi Toilet, Grimace Shake), procrastination, stress, bad weather, games with fighting/combat system/PvP, poverty</p>
