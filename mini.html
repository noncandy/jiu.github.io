<title>Noncandy's Site (Mini)</title>
<h1>Hi</h1>
<p>のんきゃんでぃです！</p>
<p>This is a more accessible and smaller version of my website. <a href="https://noncandy.github.io">Original version is there. (Warning: less accessible, too fancy)</a></p>
<p>Hi! I'm Jiu (or Noncandy) and I am a huge fan of cute things. I am 15 years old and I come from the Philippines. And idk how to code stuff like this website.</p>
<p><b>Please commission me, I'm broke!!!!</b> <a href="https://artistree.io/jiu">Here is where I sell art commissions!</a> <b>Keep in mind that I only accept object show characters despite my ability to draw humans, the reason why is because I wanted to save time for other stuff.</b> Thanks!</p>
<p>Stuff about me: Birthday is Feb 15, I'm 15 years old, I'm bi, I'm an artist, sometimes a gamer, noob musician and noob coder, AuDHD, and my brain is wonky. Someday I will use Linux. I am currently the biggest protector of Bubble BFDI.
<p>Likes: Cute things, food, Japanese street fashion, the Internet (sometimes), art, anime, open source stuff, music, friends, cute animals, funny memes, games, <s>kawaii moe anime girls</s></p>
<p>Dislikes: Politics, toxic people, war, unfunny or uninteresting memes/trends that got popular for some reason (Skibidi Toilet, Grimace Shake), procrastination, stress, bad weather, games with fighting/combat system/PvP, poverty</p>
<p>Fandoms: Idolmaster, Kirby, Pripara, Rhythm Games, Show by Rock, Animator vs Animation, Gravity Falls, Touhou. Lately I am getting into Higurashi.</p>

<h1>Important stuff</h1>
<p>Please <b>do NOT interact</b> with me if you are the following: <b>you're under 13</b>, <b>a lolicon</b> (srsly just fuck off and your "UOHHHHHH" shit)</b>, basic "DNI" criteria, supports/defends Taylor Grodin, pro/comship, <b>"Minors DNI" people (not just NSFW people, people who don't like interacting with minors too)</b>, all you talk is politics, one of those Web3 dudes</p>
  
<p>Before you follow: I draw gore (I will tag/put a CW on it accordingly and won't post if it breaks the rules), do NOT put my name into your public "enemies"/"hated users" list if you are an ex-friend of mine (It makes me uncomfy, just calmly let me know you unfriended me instead), I swear often, do NOT think I am a lolicon just because I draw young girls and has young girl characters as my fave characters (I only like them in a wholesome and endearing way)

<p>Please tag: The word "groom" (when used in a problematic matter), the word "C/P" (remove the slash) being used to refer to problematic stuff, sewer slide "jokes", gore scenes in live-action movies/TV, BFB post-split neg (for some reason)</p>
  <p>Catchcall is whatever as long as you include my name on it (like "JIU DON'T LOOK")</p>
