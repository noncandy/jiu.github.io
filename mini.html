<title>Noncandy's Site (Mini)</title>
<h1>Hi</h1>
<p>ノンキャンディです！</p>
<p>I'm currently figuring out how to make a layout on the site. Also, this will be the "mini" version of my page in case you can't handle the fanciness of the site that is going to be, but since it's unfinished, I currently use it as the main page.</p>
<p>In the meantime, hi! I'm Jiu (or Noncandy) and I am a huge fan of cute things. I am 15 years old and I come from the Philippines. And idk how to code stuff like this website.</p>
<p><b>Please commission me, I'm broke!!!!</b> <a href="https://artistree.io/jiu">Here is where I sell art commissions!</a> <b>Keep in mind that I only accept object show characters despite my ability to draw humans, the reason why is because I wanted to save time for other stuff.</b> Thanks!</p>
<p>Stuff about me: Birthday is Feb 15, I'm 15 years old, I'm bi, I'm an artist, sometimes a gamer, noob musician and noob coder, AuDHD, and my brain is wonky. Someday I will use Linux. I am currently the biggest protector of Bubble BFDI.
<p>Likes: Cute things, food, Japanese street fashion, the Internet (sometimes), art, anime, open source stuff, music, friends, cute animals, funny memes, games, <s>kawaii moe anime girls</s></p>
<p>Dislikes: Politics, toxic people, war, unfunny or uninteresting memes/trends that got popular for some reason (Skibidi Toilet, Grimace Shake), procrastination, stress, bad weather, games with fighting/combat system/PvP, poverty</p>
<p>Fandoms: Idolmaster, Kirby, Pripara, Rhythm Games, Show by Rock, Animator vs Animation, Gravity Falls, Touhou. Lately I am getting into Higurashi.</p>


<p>Please <b>do NOT interact</b> with me if you are the following: <b>you're under 13</b>, <b>a lolicon</b> (srsly just fuck off and your "UOHHHHHH" shit)</b>, basic "DNI" criteria, supports/defends Taylor Grodin, pro/comship, <b>"Minors DNI" people (not just NSFW people, people who don't like interacting with minors too)</b>, all you talk is politics, one of those Web3 dudes</p>
<p>Before you follow: I draw gore (I will tag/put a CW on it accordingly and won't post if it breaks the rules), do NOT put my name into your public "enemies"/"hated users" list if you are an ex-friend of mine (It makes me uncomfy, just calmly let me know you unfriended me instead), I swear often, do NOT think I am a lolicon just because I draw young girls and has young girl characters as my fave characters (I only like them in a wholesome and endearing way)
